Uses gtk2hs library

* [Installation of the gtk2hs library:](https://wiki.haskell.org/Gtk2Hs/Installation)
* [Closest thing to "documentation" about the gtk2hs:](http://muitovar.com/gtk2hs/index.html)
* [gtk2hs accepts GUIs built on Glade](https://glade.gnome.org/)

Tested only on Linux, compiled with [ghc](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/). But in theory should work on any platform as gtk is [multiplatform](https://www.gtk.org/features.php)
